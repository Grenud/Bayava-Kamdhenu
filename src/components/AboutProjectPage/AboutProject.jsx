        <p className='para'>The cow is an amazing divine being who carries the most powerful and sublime vibrations of the Universe,  the true mother of mankind.  She feeds her children, her people, with her own milk.  From the milk of a cow, a person creates yogurt, butter, ghee, cheese, all kinds of sweets, etc. It is impossible to imagine a day without these blissful products.  Indispensable ingredients such as ghee, which is sometimes called liquid gold; manure, which is a symbol of purification and protection; and cow urine, which is truly living water; and powerful biostimulants are in canonical Ayurveda and modern medicine.  Everything that comes from the cow, even its breath, is healing for the body and soul.  The bull in the farm plows the land, helps in sowing and harvesting, transports heavy loads and is the father of the family!  The cow and the bull are the basis  for the well-being of the family, its health and happiness.  And from the well-being in families comes the well-being of all mankind.</p>
